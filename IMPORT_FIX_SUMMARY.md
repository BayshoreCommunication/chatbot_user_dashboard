# 🔧 Import Fix Summary

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED: Import Path Error**

### 🐛 **Problem**

The leads page was failing to build due to incorrect import paths:

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Button component not in ui directory
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
```

### 🔧 **Solution**

Fixed the import path to use the correct location:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Button component is in custom directory
import { Button } from '@/components/custom/button'
```

### 📁 **Component Locations**

- ✅ `Badge` → `@/components/ui/badge`
- ✅ `Button` → `@/components/custom/button` (Fixed!)
- ✅ `Card` → `@/components/ui/card`
- ✅ `Table` → `@/components/ui/table`
- ✅ `useLeads` → `@/hooks/useLeads`

### 🎯 **Status**

- ✅ Import paths corrected
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ All components properly imported
- ✅ Leads page ready to use

### 🚀 **Next Steps**

The leads page should now build and run without any import errors. You can:

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/leads`
2. View all visitor contact information
3. Download leads data as CSV
4. See real-time statistics

**The import issue is completely resolved!** 🎉
